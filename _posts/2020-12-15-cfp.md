We invite you to participate in **Using Network Science in Learning Analytics: Building Bridges towards a Common Agenda**  at the 11th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference ([LAK21](https://lak21.solaresearch.org/)).

**To join as a presenter, please submit a 6-page summary by February 9, 2021.** All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Selected submissions will be included in CEUR-Ws Proceedings (Scopus indexed) as well as a joint LAK Companion Proceedings (published by SoLAR). Submit your work at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=netscila2021](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=netscila2021)

For any questions contact Sasha Poquet <sspoquet@gmail.com> or anyone else on the workshop committee.

### Call for Participation

Given the diversity of the applications of network science to learning analytics, this workshop aims to identify common challenges experienced through the use of network science methodologies in learning analytics. The workshop invites researchers working on the intersection of learning analytics and network science to share their work and reflect on common challenges. We envision themes of causality, linkage between micro- and macro-processes, use of time and space, elements of generalizability and validity to surface in the group discussions. The workshop hopes to gather LA scholars to build a foundation for network modelling of learning data and shape strategies of future work in this important sub-field of LA.

We welcome various types of submissions to the workshop including (but are not limited to):

- Empirical studies applying advanced network analytical techniques, including understanding properties of networks in learning settings as well as deriving insights about learning built on network analysis
- Conceptual papers bridging learning processes and network representations
- Methodological papers introducing approaches built off network analysis or integrating it with other methods
- Demos featuring tools to support sensemaking of network data or enabling network analysis
- Classroom applications of network analysis for reflection and regulation of learning processes.

We would like for the authors to include a brief reflection on the challenges of the application of network science to learning data as a part of their submission. 

### Workshop Objectives and Format

To explore the application of advanced theory-informed network analysis and modeling to learning data through sharing of research-in-progress or tool demos;

- To explore means of connecting multiple analytical dimensions through network analysis;
- To share and brainstorm novel network metrics;
- To connect researchers with shared interest towards forming a sub-community leading future development in this area.

We hope to attract thematically diverse submissions of similar methodological considerations. Participants will present their contributions in short talks, with two open group discussions. The event will take place online. Information about selected submissions, once available, will be published on the workshop's page: [https://colig.github.io/lak-network/](https://colig.github.io/lak-network/)

### Participation and Submissions

This HALF-DAY workshop will be held online on April 12, 2020. We invite you to attend the workshop as a presenter or a participant.

To join as a presenter, please send a 6-page summary of your work ([LAK companion proceedings template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rehwgxhus851c0a/LAK20_Companion_Proceedings_Template.doc?dl=0), including references) that you intend to share following the Companion Proceedings Template (including references) by February 9, 2021. Please submit your work: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=netscila2021

Notification of acceptance will be sent out by February 23, 2021. Presenters need to register for the workshop during the LAK registration process.

Accepted workshop papers will be published in CEUR-Ws Proceedings (Scopus indexed), on the workshop website and in a joint LAK Companion Proceedings (published by SoLAR). Additional workshop materials will also be shared via the workshop website.

Anyone with an interest in the area is welcome to register as a participant.

### Timeline

<!-- 
This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box. -->
